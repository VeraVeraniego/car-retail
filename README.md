# COOL CARS - CAR RETAIL
Cool cars is a web page that let's its users see cars stored in the Database, they can publish car of their own, and if they have an account they can save cars as favorites, cars which will be shown in the favorites tab.

## HOW TO USE
You can access through the [deployed site](https://coolcars.netlify.app) on `netlify.app` I created a example user so anyone who visits this link can log to use the site, you can use `test@example.com` to log to the site and test favorites functionality!  
  
By the other hand if you want to **install** this project you can **clone** this repository and install dependencies in the folder where you cloned it using `npm install` after that you will be able to run the project using `npm run dev` we use this command since this project bundle is made out of *ViteJS*.

## Developer Comments
The process of developing this project was fun and enriching since I learned a lot of things while writing code, I struggled a little when I had to handle the queries with variables, and a bit more when handling the cache, but one way or another I get to fulfill all the requirements of the project. Writing this lines just makes me wonder how cool of a career I have chosen for myself.
